The [[Podcast]] starts with service work being discussed, via an anecdote about [[Jordan's Burritos]]. A host – Jordan Cornish – claims that she'd be a barista rather than a [[Journalist]], despite working as a journalist. She draws similarities being a barista in Qatar, and draws attention to the fact that [[Migrant]] workers in Canada consist the bulk of manual labor positions, claiming that the country is headed to a similar state than Qatar.
